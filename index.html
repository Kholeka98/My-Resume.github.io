  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p> 
    As an Honours Mathematics graduate from the University of Pretoria, I have a strong foundation in data analytics. 
    I have completed data analytics courses, which enabled me to apply my analytical skills to real-world scenarios 
    and datasets. I have also gained proficiency in database management systems, such as MySQL, through online courses and hands-on projects.</p>

    <p> In addition, I have experience as a Teaching Assistant at the University of Pretoria, where I assisted students with their exercises and 
explained challenging concepts for the entire class. I also invigilated and marked tests and assignments, demonstrating accuracy and 
attention to detail. I successfully managed multiple responsibilities during campus transitions, showing adaptability and effective 
multitasking skills. I am motivated by curiosity and continuously seek to enhance my skills by solving problems and learning new tools. 
I have a collaborative nature, an open-minded approach, and a trustworthy personality. 
I excel in both team settings and independent settings, and I am eager to contribute to the data analytics and business analytics field.</p>
